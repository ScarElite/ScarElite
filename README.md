## About Me...
Hi there, I'm a graduate of the UNC Chapel Hill Coding Boot Camp that teaches students how to become a Full Stack Web Developer. The beginning of my coding journey was an accident. It was a time in my life where nothing was going on for me and I was mindlessly scrolling through social media. I came across the same ad for a coding course, Front End Simplified, many many times. I finally decided to give it a try and after a couple of days of coding I was hooked. People in my life always told me they could see me becoming a web developer but I always thought it wouldn't be something I was interested in and I was of course WRONG. I started to look for another way that I could continue my journey and that's where I found the Coding Boot Camp offered by UNC Chapel Hill and I continued my journey in July of 2022. This program is 6 months long and I graduated in January of 2023. During the program I learned so much and I'm eager to continue learning and become a better Full Stack Web Developer. I absolutely love coding and I'm excited for all of the things I will create!
