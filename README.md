## About Me...
### Hi there, my name is Mitchell Armstrong. I'm currently enrolled in the UNC Chapel Hill Coding Bootcamp to learn how to become a Fullstack Web Developer. I originally looked into FrontEnd Simplified, while it was in its early stages, to become a front end developer. After a couple of days of coding I was hooked. I did some research on how to learn to code and be a successful developer without getting a college degree as I don't have the time or money for that. I found the Coding Bootcamp offered by UNC Chapel Hill and started my journey in July 2022! This program is 6 months long and ends in January 2023. Since starting this course I have learned so much and I'm eager to continue learning and become a Fullstack web developer. I absoluelty love coding and I'm excited for all of the things I will create!
